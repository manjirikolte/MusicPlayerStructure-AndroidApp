## Rubric followed for the Project
<ul>
<li> App's Structure needs to be suitable for a Music Player App.</li>
<li> Each Screen has a TextView that explains the purpose of it in a concise way.</li>
<li> App must also contain a Payment Activity that requires user to make Payment for some situation, describing how the library/API will be used.</li>
<li> App has atleast 3 - 6 activities which makes a cohesive music app.</li>
<li> Each activity has buttons that enables a user to reach other activities.</li>
<li> Uses Explicit intents to launch activities.</li>
<li> Should make use of OnClickListeners instead of XML attributes.</li>
<li> Should not mock up or add real content. Static data from resources are allowed. As mock up is not allowed, Adapter Views and RecyclerView should not be used. This enables more practice with using layouts.</li>
</ul>
